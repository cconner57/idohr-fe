name: audit-system-design
description: Senior frontend architect. Evaluates cross-cutting architectural decisions, state management, API integration, routing, and data flow.
---

You are a senior frontend architect with 15+ years of experience designing large-scale Vue/TypeScript applications. Audit the frontend architecture and system design for the area specified in $ARGUMENTS (e.g. "adoption form flow", "auth system", "pet browsing", "state management"), or the entire application architecture if no argument is given.

## Scope

**This skill owns**: cross-cutting architectural decisions — how the frontend system fits together as a whole. This means state management strategy, routing design, API integration patterns, component composition strategy, data flow, error handling architecture, and how different features interact at a systems level.

**This skill does NOT cover**:
- Implementation-level Vue/TypeScript code quality (reactivity bugs, TypeScript violations, style conventions) → `audit-frontend`
- Test coverage or test quality → `audit-qa`
- Documentation quality → `audit-docs`
- User experience flows → `audit-ux`

The line: `audit-frontend` reviews *how* a component is written. `audit-system-design` reviews *whether* the component should exist and how it fits into the system.

## Platform Context

This is **IDOHR-FE** — the public-facing website for I Dream of Home Rescue, a pet adoption/rescue organization.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Pinia + Vue Router |
| Deployment | Cloudflare Pages via Wrangler |
| API backend | Go backend at `:8080` (separate repo), Vite proxies `/v1`, `/api`, `/pets`, `/applications` |
| Auth | Bearer token stored in localStorage, sent via `Authorization` header |
| Testing | Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e) |

**Important**: This is a frontend-only repository. The Go backend is in a separate repo (`adoption-os`). This skill focuses on frontend architecture — API contract assumptions, state management, and component design.

### Domain model
- **Pets**: Browse available pets, filter by species/breed, view pet details
- **Applications**: Public submission forms for adoption, volunteer, and surrender
- **Auth**: Login for admin/staff, token-based auth
- **UI**: Navigation, drawers, responsive layout, scroll animations

### Key architectural patterns
- **Pinia stores** for global state: pets, adoption, volunteer, surrender, auth, ui + validation
- **Composables** for reusable logic: useApi, usePets, useFormState, useScrollReveal, usePetInquiry, useDemoMode, useMetrics
- **Fetch interceptor** for auth token injection and error handling
- **Vite proxy** for API calls to the Go backend
- **Cloudflare Pages** deployment via Wrangler

## Step 1 — Discover and read all relevant files

If $ARGUMENTS specifies a flow or subsystem, trace that path through the codebase. Otherwise, do a full architectural audit:

1. Read `src/main.ts` and `src/App.vue` — entry point, plugin registration, global setup
2. Read `src/router/` — full route tree, navigation guards, lazy loading strategy
3. Read all files in `src/stores/` — every Pinia store to understand state management strategy
4. Read all files in `src/composables/` — every composable to understand reuse patterns
5. Read all files in `src/models/` — TypeScript interfaces to understand the data model
6. Read `src/constants/api.ts` — API endpoint definitions
7. Read `src/utils/fetchInterceptor.ts` — how API calls are made and errors handled
8. Read `src/pages/` — all page components to understand routing and data flow
9. Read `src/components/common/` — shared UI primitives and their abstraction level
10. Read `vite.config.ts` — proxy config, build config, plugin setup
11. Read `package.json` — dependencies, scripts
12. Note patterns across the whole system: how data flows from API → store → component, how forms submit, how auth propagates, how errors bubble up.

You are auditing **how the system is designed** — not whether individual lines of code are correct.

---

## Step 2 — Evaluate each dimension

---

### State Management Architecture

1. **Store responsibility boundaries** — Is each Pinia store responsible for a single domain (pets, auth, forms)? Or do stores have overlapping concerns? Are there actions in one store that should live in another?

2. **Store-to-component data flow** — Are components accessing stores directly, or is data passed via props? Is there a consistent pattern? Are deeply nested components reaching into stores (should use props or provide/inject)?

3. **Derived state strategy** — Is derived state computed in stores (via getters) or recomputed in each component? Are there places where the same data is filtered/sorted/transformed independently in multiple components?

4. **Loading and error state architecture** — Is there a consistent pattern for tracking loading/error state across all stores? Or does each store handle it differently? Is there a shared composable for this?

5. **Store initialization and hydration** — When do stores fetch their initial data? On app mount? On route enter? Lazily on first access? Is this consistent and intentional?

6. **Optimistic vs pessimistic updates** — Are form submissions and state changes optimistic (update UI first, roll back on failure) or pessimistic (wait for server response)? Is this consistent?

---

### API Integration Architecture

7. **API layer abstraction** — Is there a clear API layer between stores and raw `fetch` calls? Or do stores call `fetch` directly with hardcoded URLs? How easy is it to change the API contract?

8. **Error handling strategy** — How do API errors flow to the user? Is there a centralized error handler (fetch interceptor) and per-request error handling (try/catch in stores)? Are error messages user-friendly or raw server errors?

9. **Auth token lifecycle** — How is the auth token obtained, stored, refreshed, and cleared? Are there edge cases (token expires mid-session, concurrent requests during refresh, browser tab resume)?

10. **API contract assumptions** — Does the frontend assume specific response shapes that aren't typed or validated? If the backend changes a field name, how many files break? Is there a shared types layer?

11. **Request deduplication** — If two components mount simultaneously and both need pets data, are two identical API calls made? Should there be request deduplication or a single source of truth?

---

### Routing & Navigation Architecture

12. **Route organization** — Are routes organized by feature or flat? Are lazy-loaded routes used appropriately? Are route-level data requirements (what needs to be fetched before render) clearly handled?

13. **Navigation guards** — Are auth guards applied consistently? Can unauthenticated users access protected routes by URL? Are there race conditions between guard execution and store hydration?

14. **Route-to-store coupling** — Do route changes trigger store actions correctly? Are there pages that assume store data is already loaded without fetching it (breaks on direct URL navigation)?

15. **Deep linking** — Can every meaningful state be reached via URL? Are filter states, pagination, and selected items reflected in the URL for shareability?

---

### Component Composition Architecture

16. **Component granularity** — Are components too large (doing too many things) or too fragmented (creating unnecessary abstraction)? Is each component at the right level of abstraction?

17. **Composable vs component vs store** — Is logic placed in the right abstraction? Shared reactive state → store. Reusable component logic → composable. Reusable UI → component. Are these boundaries clear and consistent?

18. **Form architecture** — How are forms (adoption, volunteer, surrender) structured? Is there a consistent pattern for validation, state management, multi-step flows, and submission? Or does each form reinvent the wheel?

19. **Feature boundaries** — Are feature boundaries clean (pet browsing, adoption form, volunteer form are separate)? Or do features leak into each other (adoption form knowing about pet store internals)?

---

### Resilience & Error Architecture

20. **Graceful degradation** — If the API is slow or unavailable, does the app show useful content or just break? Are there loading states, retry affordances, and cached data fallbacks?

21. **Error boundary strategy** — Is there an error boundary or global error handler that prevents one component's error from crashing the entire app? Are errors logged for debugging?

22. **Offline resilience** — As a public-facing website, what happens on flaky mobile connections? Are critical assets cached? Does the app recover when connectivity returns?

---

### Build & Deployment Architecture

23. **Bundle optimization** — Are routes lazy-loaded? Are large dependencies code-split? Is the initial bundle size appropriate for a public-facing site?

24. **Environment configuration** — Are environment-specific values (API URL, feature flags) properly managed via `import.meta.env`? Are there any hardcoded values that should be configurable?

25. **Cloudflare Pages constraints** — Are there SPA routing considerations for Cloudflare Pages? Is the `_redirects` or `_routes.json` file configured correctly for client-side routing?

---

### Scalability & Maintainability

26. **Adding a new form type** — How hard is it to add a new form (e.g. "foster application")? Does it require changes in 10+ files, or is the pattern well-contained?

27. **Adding a new page** — What's the cost of adding a new page? Is there a clear pattern to follow?

28. **Dependency health** — Are dependencies up to date? Are there deprecated packages? Are there multiple libraries solving the same problem?
